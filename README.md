# pre-work-study-guide webpage
## Description
The idea of coding for me it seemed unreachable at first. I thought I don't have the skills to do it, but after doing some research and studying the Bootcamp's, it seems like a domain I might be able to tackle. I built this project to see if I'm capable of moving forward with this chapter. I did it with a lot of Googling, Stackoverflow and noticing how easy is for the eye to miss something.
